Features:

Voice Recognition: This ESP32 listens to the input you give using the microphone and processes the answer. And give you the answer on OLED Display. It will accurately listen to the input and will give a more precise answer as if using the Vosk model.

Translation: It also translates what you say the model I'm using here is Hindi to English I'm using Argos model for translation so if I say "Udhar Kya Hai?" in Hindi so it will write it's version in English format on OLED display and even speak it it will be like "What is there?".
